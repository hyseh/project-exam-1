## Description

In this project, you will find a gaming blog. All content is stored on a WordPress installation and I am making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data needed. The website is responsive but can use improvements to better the experience on various devices.

**Note:** This is a school project and I do not intend to keep it updated. Feel free to use any inspiration from this project if you want.
